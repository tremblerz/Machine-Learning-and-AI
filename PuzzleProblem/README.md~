Hello User!
This is README file for puzzle problem solver

For our case here are some results for 10K test cases---------->>>>

Mean value for BFS 0.00012863
Standard deviation is 0.00843937
Mean value for DFS 0.00004491
Standard deviation is 0.00416382


This folder contains .....
 
1.Test cases generator 
2.Sample output for multiple test Cases in both DFS and BFS
3.Test Case file with 20K test cases
4.source code
5.Executable code
6.Standard Deviation and Mean generator



In this programme you can provide two states of a puzzle and hence can find out whether there exists a path betwee given state or not.

------------Usage ---------------

Sample Input =>

1.
./a.out bfs
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0

0 1 2
3 4 5
8 7 6

2.
./a.out dfs
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0

0 1 2
4 6 5
8 7 3

Sample Output =>
1.
Path found
Time taken by DFS Algorithm = x.xxxxxx seconds

2.
Path Not found
Time taken by BFS Algorithm = x.xxxxxx seconds

-------------Usage Over---------------
